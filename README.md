# CSE231-Project-5
Analyzes exoplanet data to determine habitability and classify planets as rocky or gaseous. It reads a CSV file, calculates distances in light-years, and evaluates habitability based on planet mass, radius, and star characteristics. The script identifies the closest habitable rocky and gaseous planets, providing insights into exoplanetary systems.
