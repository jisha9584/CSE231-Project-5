  Computer Project #5
<br>
  Print the welcome statements
  <br>
    define functions
    <br>
       1. open file
       <br>
       2. make float using parameters
       <br>
       3. density
       <br>
       4. temp in range
       <br>
       5. temp in range
       <br>
    define main
    <br>
       open file --> skip the first line 
       <br>
       define all the variables in the main not at the begining
       <br>
       convert distance to PARSEC Light Year (by multiplication)
       <br>
       lines can directly be converted to make_float()
       <br>
       call the functions to calculate habitibilty and clasify them as rocky or gaseous 
       <br>
       use string.txt for formating (be careful it is ENTER NOT INPUT for openfile)
       <br>
       the parameters for rocky and gaseous should be smalled than max_distance
       <br>
       close file
       <br>
       print the last 6 statements (put conditions for rocky and gaseous)
