  Print the welcome statements \n
    define functions
       1. open file
       2. make float using parameters
       3. density
       4. temp in range
       5. temp in range
    define main
       open file --> skip the first line 
       define all the variables in the main not at the begining 
       convert distance to PARSEC Light Year (by multiplication)
       lines can directly be converted to make_float() 
       call the functions to calculate habitibilty and clasify them as rocky 
       or gaseous 
       use string.txt for formating (be careful it is ENTER NOT INPUT for openfile)
       the parameters for rocky and gaseous should be smalled than max_distance
       close file
       print the last 6 statements (put conditions for rocky and gaseous)
